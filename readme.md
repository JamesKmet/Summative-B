#### Project description:

The website in question is designed for being a simulation of a booking system for the New Zealand Tourism company. The site is a single page layout where the user scrolls down as they fill out forms that will direct them to the desired outcome.

The home page consists of a nice cover photo and call to action that when clicked will start the booking process.
	A series of modals and calls to action will direct the user through the booking process.

#### Validation:

Html validated with W3 schools validation system.
CSS validated with W3 schools validation system.
Javascript validated with Gulp validation system.



#### Javascript style guide reference
I have used JavaScript standard style for my style guide of choice. I have attempted to hadher to those standards to the best of my ability. These conventions are as follows.
1.  Use 2 spaces for indentation.
2.  Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
3.  No unused variables.
4.  Infix operators must be spaced.
5.  Always use === instead of ==.
6.  Commas should have a space after them.
7.  Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
8.  Multiple blank lines not allowed.
9.  For var declarations, write each declaration in its own statement.
10. Wrap conditional assignments
11. Use camelcase when naming variables and functions.
12. space between colon and value in key value pairs.
13. No duplicate arguments in function definitions.
14. Avoid unnecessary function binding.

I have attempted to adhere to these standards layout for JavaScript standard to the best of my ability. Due to some over sites I had to go through making sure that I adjusted my code to fit with all standards. I believe I have got them all however if I missed any it was unintentional.

#### Elvulation.
This has been a very challenging assignment for me but I am happy with the way that it turned out, plus I have learned so much from this. I could write pages upon pages about the challenges I faced and my solutions but instead I will list problems I had to solve and the solutions for these problems.
